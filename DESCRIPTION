Description:
	The package called "geneTypes" provides a set of S4 classes for different gene types.
	The gene types included in the package are protein-coding genes, long noncoding RNA
	genes, microRNA genes, rRNA genes, and tRNA genes. All of these S4 classes are inherited
	from a virtual gene class that represents genes in general. In the package, there are
	additional S4 classes that represent the products (proteins, lncRNAs, microRNAs, rRNAs,
	and tRNAs) of each gene class. These S4 classes that represent the products of the genes
	are inherited from a virtual product class.
